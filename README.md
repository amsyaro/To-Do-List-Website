# To-Do-List-Website

This system is a web-based application that allows users to manage their daily tasks and schedule.
The system should provide the following functions:

● Register a new user account, user login to access the system, manage the sessions.

● Manage user profile (view, update user details, delete a user account).

● Manage tasks to be able to view, add, edit and delete tasks.

● Categorize tasks based on priority and deadline.

● Manage task status based on completed, in-progress and to-do.

● View task progress using suitable visualization graphs/charts to show the completion rate based on priority and deadline 
(e.g. using visualization concepts showcase the completion ratio between different priority tasks ina selected duration of time).

● Set Reminder to remind users on the task, due date and priority 
(e.g. if a task due date is 1 day away there is some factor that demonstrates it, maybe higher priority tasks have a reminder 
set for 3 days prior to its due date).
